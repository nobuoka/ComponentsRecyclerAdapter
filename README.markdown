ComponentsRecyclerAdapter
==============================

This library provides `ComponentsRecyclerAdapter`, the subclass of RecyclerView.Adapter.
Using it, you can easily create RecyclerView with multiple view types, or with complex data hierarchy
(e.g. list composed of multiple sublists, list having â€œread more" buttons or progress bars, etc.).

This project is under development!

## Usage

Please see [the `ExampleAdapter` class](./demo/src/main/java/info/vividcode/android/app/example/cra/ExampleAdapter.java)
